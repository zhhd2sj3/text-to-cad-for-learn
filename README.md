## 🧰 Skills

Install the library to give agents focused workflows for CAD, fabrication,
robot description files, simulation, and local review.

## 💻 Installation

Install or clone from `main`: it is the source tree, and every skill's
`requirements.txt` pins the `cadgen` release it was published with. (`models/`,
the fixture corpus, arrives as small LFS pointers and is not needed to use the
skills.)

### Skills

Install text-to-cad with the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add earthtojake/text-to-cad
```

This is the preferred installation path. It installs the individual skills
directly for supported agents.

**Use the same command to update.** `add` re-fetches the package and overwrites
what is already installed, so it both refreshes existing skills and installs any
skill added in a newer release. `npx skills update` only refreshes skills already
in your lockfile, so it silently misses new ones — which matters here, because
releases do add skills.

Neither command removes a skill that was retired upstream; drop one with
`npx skills remove <skill>` if you need to.

(`npx skills install …` still works — it is an undocumented alias for `add`.)

### Plugins

Provider-native plugin installs are also available for Codex, Claude Code, and
Grok Build:

```bash
# Codex (requires Codex 0.142.0 or newer)
codex plugin marketplace add earthtojake/text-to-cad
codex plugin add cad@text-to-cad
```

Codex resolves this repository-root plugin only from 0.142.0 onward. On older
versions the plugin is skipped silently and never appears in `codex plugin list`;
upgrade with `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest`.

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add earthtojake/text-to-cad
claude plugin install cad@text-to-cad
```

Grok Build uses the existing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; there is no
separate Grok plugin manifest.

```bash
# Grok Build
grok plugin install earthtojake/text-to-cad --trust
grok plugin enable cad
```

Restart your agent if newly installed skills do not appear. For local
development, branch from `main`, open PRs against `main`, and follow
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
